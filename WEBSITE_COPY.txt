<h3> SUBSECTION TITLE:
Bathtub Reglazing vs Refinishing: What's the Difference?

---[MEDIUM SEO]---
<p> REGLAZING VS REFINISHING EXPLANATION:
Bathtub reglazing and bathtub refinishing are often used interchangeably, and for good reason—they refer to the same professional restoration process. While some use "reglazing" to specifically describe the application of a new coating, refinishing is the broader term that encompasses the entire process: surface preparation, repairs (such as chips, cracks, and tub cut outs), acid etching, and applying a durable finish. Whether you search for "bathtub reglazing near me" or "bathtub refinishing," you'll find the same high-quality service. At JLS Reglazing, we specialize in both terms because we provide complete bathtub and kitchen surface restoration—from foundation repairs to the final glossy coat. The result is always the same: a like-new surface at a fraction of replacement cost.
